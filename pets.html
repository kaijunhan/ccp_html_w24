            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width="400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">
        
            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can
                pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has
                no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He
                will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is
                also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

            <p>Sprout, a shy and elusive kitten when he first arrived at four months old, gradually became an affectionate companion.
            He enjoyed sleeping on my bed, but his early morning wake-up calls at 6:30 AM were a daily routine.</p>
            <p>During my challenging academic phase, Sprout became my constant companion during late-night drawing sessions, quietly
            curling up on my lap, providing comfort and banishing solitude.</p>
